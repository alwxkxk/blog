&emsp;I'm a programmer and need to make some simple 3D model to showing in web,such as [iot-visualization-examples](https://github.com/alwxkxk/iot-visualization-examples).UV map is one of the most important for making 3D model.There are so many relative tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=c4d+uv+texture+tutorial).However,some ways is so complex while I just want to map a simple model.There are so many things can make just by box model mapping with relative picture.



## one ploygon one picture
&emsp;Take air conditioner as an example.Google a picture about air conditioner and crop it without padding:
<img alt="air conditioner" src="/blog_images/air conditioner.jpg" style="width:40%;">
1. Make the model editable.
2. Add material with picture texture.
3. Select one polygon and drag the material.

&emsp;We can [bake object](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBj2V4MGqUQ) to make all pictures into one.

## change UV map the picture
&emsp;Many UV map tutorial is show how to unwrap model, export UV map and edit the picture to suit the UV map.Actually,We can edit UV suit the picture.In this way,We can pick what we want from the picture.([polygonalmind](http://www.polygonalmind.com/downloadcentre.html) make many model only by a picture texture.)
1. Add material with picture texture.
2. Drag the material to the model.
3. Edit UV.


&emsp;Take [polygonalmind](http://www.polygonalmind.com/downloadcentre.html) picture as an example, YouTube video:
